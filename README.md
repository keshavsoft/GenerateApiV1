# KeshavAI – Voice to Text for VS Code (Windows)

KeshavAI is a **VS Code extension** that converts **spoken audio from your microphone into text** using a fully **offline speech-to-text pipeline**.

No cloud APIs or internet connection are required.

The extension uses:

* **SoX** – to capture microphone audio
* **Whisper.cpp** – to transcribe speech locally
* **Node.js (VS Code extension host)** – to control the workflow

---

# How It Works

The extension follows this pipeline:

```
Microphone
   ↓
SoX (record audio)
   ↓
voice.wav
   ↓
Whisper.cpp
   ↓
Transcribed text
   ↓
VS Code popup
```

Everything runs **locally on your machine**.

---
